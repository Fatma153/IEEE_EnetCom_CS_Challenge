This reposotory is included in IEEE CS challenge TSYP 2022 from IEEE ENETâ€™COM team  

This repository provides  an intelligent  segmentated images of the moon surfaces which found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedchtourou2021/data-cs   

and provides with a 3D modeling visualisation of mars and moon   

 

Contents 

 

Mars :  scripts to build 3D mars models 

Main: Main script that trains the CNN model. Contains trained models

Moon : scripts to build 3D moon models  

Data :  scripts to open the dataset and show the input  model  

Releases :  scripts and data as inputs in 3D moon models and 3D mars  models 

 

 

 

REMARKS :   

To make the scripts running all we need is: 

 to install pyvista library  

To install tensorflow and pickle  library  

To install vtk library
